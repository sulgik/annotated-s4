#
# The [Structured State Space for Sequence
# Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396) (S4) architecture is a new approach to very
# long-range sequence modeling tasks for vision,
# language, and audio, showing a capacity to capture dependencies over tens
# of thousands of steps. Especially impressive are the model's results on the challenging
# [Long Range Arena](https://github.com/google-research/long-range-arena) benchmark, showing an ability
# to reason over sequences of up to **16,000+** elements with high accuracy.

# <img src="images/table.png" width="100%"/>

# The paper is also a refreshing departure from Transformers, taking a
# very different approach to an important problem-space.  However,
# several of our colleagues have also noted privately the difficulty
# of gaining intuition for the model.  This blog post is a first step
# towards this goal of gaining intuition, linking concrete code
# implementations with explanations from the S4 paper – very much in
# the style of [the annotated
# Transformer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html).
# Hopefully this combination of code and literate explanations helps
# you follow the details of the model. By the end of the blog you will
# have an efficient working version of S4 that can operate as a CNN
# for training, but then convert to an efficient RNN at test time.  To
# preview the results, you will be able to generate images from pixels
# and sounds directly from audio waves on a standard GPU.

# ## Part 1: State Space Models

# Let's get started! Our goal is the efficient
# modeling of long sequences. To do this, we are going to build a
# new neural network layer based on State Space Models. By the end of
# this section we will be able to build and run a model with this layer.
# However, we are going to need some technical background. Let's work
# our way through the background of the paper.

# > The [state space model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-space_representation) is defined by this simple equation.
# > It maps a 1-D input signal $u(t)$ to an $N$-D latent state $x(t)$
# > before projecting to a 1-D output signal $y(t)$.
# $$
#   \begin{aligned}
#     x'(t) &= \boldsymbol{A}x(t) + \boldsymbol{B}u(t) \\
#     y(t) &= \boldsymbol{C}x(t) + \boldsymbol{D}u(t)
#   \end{aligned}
# $$
# > Our goal is
# > to simply use the SSM as a black-box representation in a deep
# > sequence model, where $\boldsymbol{A}, \boldsymbol{B}, \boldsymbol{C}, \boldsymbol{D}$ are
# > parameters learned by gradient descent.  For the remainder, we will
# > omit the parameter $\boldsymbol{D}$ for exposition (or equivalently,
# > assume $\boldsymbol{D} = 0$  because the term $\boldsymbol{D}u$ can be
# > viewed as a skip connection and is easy to compute).
# >
# > An SSM maps a input $u(t)$ to a state representation vector $x(t)$ and an output $y(t)$.
# > For simplicity, we assume the input and output are one-dimensional, and the state representation
# > is $N$-dimensional. The first equation defines the change in $x(t)$ over time.

# Our SSMs will be defined by three matrices – $\boldsymbol{A}, \boldsymbol{B}, \boldsymbol{C}$ – which
# we will learn. For now we begin with a random SSM, to define sizes,


def random_SSM(rng, N):
    a_r, b_r, c_r = jax.random.split(rng, 3)
    A = jax.random.uniform(a_r, (N, N))
    B = jax.random.uniform(b_r, (N, 1))
    C = jax.random.uniform(c_r, (1, N))
    return A, B, C


# ### Discrete-time SSM: The Recurrent Representation
#
# > To be applied on a discrete input sequence $(u_0, u_1, \dots )$
# > instead of continuous function $u(t)$, the SSM must be
# > discretized by a **step size** $\Delta$ that represents the
# > resolution of the input.  Conceptually, the inputs $u_k$ can be
# > viewed as sampling an implicit underlying continuous signal $u(t)$,
# > where $u_k = u(k \Delta)$.
# >
# > To discretize the continuous-time SSM, we use
# > the [bilinear method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_transform), which converts the
# > state matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ into an approximation $\boldsymbol{\overline{A}}$.  The discrete SSM is:
# $$
# \begin{aligned}
#   \boldsymbol{\overline{A}} &= (\boldsymbol{I} - \Delta/2 \cdot \boldsymbol{A})^{-1}(\boldsymbol{I} + \Delta/2 \cdot \boldsymbol{A}) \\
#   \boldsymbol{\overline{B}} &= (\boldsymbol{I} - \Delta/2 \cdot \boldsymbol{A})^{-1} \Delta \boldsymbol{B} \\
#   \boldsymbol{\overline{C}} &= \boldsymbol{C}\\
# \end{aligned}
# $$


def discretize(A, B, C, step):
    I = np.eye(A.shape[0])
    BL = inv(I - (step / 2.0) * A)
    Ab = BL @ (I + (step / 2.0) * A)
    Bb = (BL * step) @ B
    return Ab, Bb, C


# > This equation is now a *sequence-to-sequence* map $u_k \mapsto y_k$ instead of function-to-function.
# > Moreover the state equation is now a recurrence in $x_k$, allowing the discrete SSM to be computed like an RNN.
# > Concretely, $x_k \in \mathbb{R}^N$ can be viewed as a *hidden state* with transition matrix $\boldsymbol{\overline{A}}$.
# $$
# \begin{aligned}
#   x_{k} &= \boldsymbol{\overline{A}} x_{k-1} + \boldsymbol{\overline{B}} u_k\\
#   y_k &= \boldsymbol{\overline{C}} x_k \\
# \end{aligned}
# $$

# As the paper says, this "step" function does look superficially like that of
# an RNN. We can implement this with a
# [scan](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.scan.html)
# in JAX,


def scan_SSM(Ab, Bb, Cb, u, x0):
    def step(x_k_1, u_k):
        x_k = Ab @ x_k_1 + Bb @ u_k
        y_k = Cb @ x_k
        return x_k, y_k

    return jax.lax.scan(step, x0, u)


# Putting everything together, we can run the SSM
# by first discretizing, then iterating step by step,


def run_SSM(A, B, C, u):
    L = u.shape[0]
    N = A.shape[0]
    Ab, Bb, Cb = discretize(A, B, C, step=1.0 / L)

    # Run recurrence
    return scan_SSM(Ab, Bb, Cb, u[:, np.newaxis], np.zeros((N,)))[1]


# ### Tangent: A Mechanics Example

#  SSM 구현을 더 직관적으로 이해하기 위해, 머신러닝에서 잠깐 물러서서, [역학에서 고전적인 예제](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-space_representation#Moving_object_example) 를 살펴봅니다.
 
# 이 예제에서는 한 덩어리가 벽으로부터 전방위치 $y(t)$ 에 스프링으로 연결되어 있습니다.
# 시간이 지나면서 이 덩어리는 다양한 힘 $u(t)$ 를 받습니다. 이 시스템의 매개변수는 질량 ($m$), 스프링 상수 ($k$), 마찰상수 ($b$) 로 구성되어 있습니다. 
# 다음의 미분방정식을 통해 이들 관계를 나타냅니다:

# $$\begin{aligned}
# my''(t) = u(t) - by'(t) - ky(t)
# \end{aligned}
# $$


# 행렬을 이용하면 다음의 요소로 이루어진 SSM 이 됩니다:

# $$
# \begin{aligned}
# \boldsymbol{A} &= \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -k/m & -b/m \end{bmatrix}  \\
# \boldsymbol{B} & = \begin{bmatrix} 0  \\ 1/m \end{bmatrix} & \boldsymbol{C} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0  \end{bmatrix}  \\
# \end{aligned}
# $$


def example_mass(k, b, m):
    A = np.array([[0, 1], [-k / m, -b / m]])
    B = np.array([[0], [1.0 / m]])
    C = np.array([[1.0, 0]])
    return A, B, C


#  Looking at the $\boldsymbol{C}$, we should be able to convince ourselves that the
#  first dimension of the hidden state is the position (since that becomes $y(t)$).
#  The second dimension is the velocity, as it is impacted by $u(t)$ through
#  $\boldsymbol{B}$. The transition $\boldsymbol{A}$ relates these terms.
#

# We'll set $u$ to be a continuous function of $t$,


@partial(np.vectorize, signature="()->()")
def example_force(t):
    x = np.sin(10 * t)
    return x * (x > 0.5)


#  Let's run this SSM through our code.

    ssm = example_mass(k=40, b=5, m=1)

    # L samples of u(t).

# Neat! And that it was just 1 SSM, with 2 hidden states over 100 steps.
# The final model will have had **100s of stacked SSMs** over **thousands of steps**. But first – we
# need to make these models practical to train.

# ### Training SSMs: The Convolutional Representation

# The punchline of this section is that we can turn the "RNN" above into a "CNN"
# by unrolling. Let's go through the derivation.

# > The recurrent SSM is not practical for training on modern hardware
# > due to its sequential nature.  Instead, there is a well-known connection
# > between linear time-invariant (LTI) SSMs and
# > continuous convolutions.  Correspondingly, the recurrent SSM can actually be
# > written as a [discrete convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution#Discrete_convolution).
# >
# > For simplicity let the initial state be $x_{-1} = 0$. Then unrolling  explicitly yields:
# >
# $$
# \begin{aligned}
#   x_0 &= \boldsymbol{\overline{B}} u_0 &
#   x_1 &= \boldsymbol{\overline{A}} \boldsymbol{\overline{B}} u_0 + \boldsymbol{\overline{B}} u_1 &
#   x_2 &= \boldsymbol{\overline{A}}^2 \boldsymbol{\overline{B}} u_0 + \boldsymbol{\overline{A}} \boldsymbol{\overline{B}} u_1 + \boldsymbol{\overline{B}} u_2 & \dots
#   \\

#   & \dots
# \end{aligned}
# $$
# >
# > This can be vectorized into a convolution with an explicit formula for the convolution kernel.
# >
# $$
# \begin{aligned}
#     y_k &= \boldsymbol{\overline{C}} \boldsymbol{\overline{A}}^k \boldsymbol{\overline{B}} u_0 + \boldsymbol{\overline{C}} \boldsymbol{\overline{A}}^{k-1} \boldsymbol{\overline{B}} u_1 + \dots + \boldsymbol{\overline{C}} \boldsymbol{\overline{A}} \boldsymbol{\overline{B}} u_{k-1} + \boldsymbol{\overline{C}}\boldsymbol{\overline{B}} u_k

# \end{aligned}

# Warning: this implementation is naive and unstable. In practice it will fail to work
# for more than very small lengths. However, we are going to replace it with S4 in Part 2, so for
# now we just keep it around as a placeholder.


# We can compute the result of applying this filter either with a standard direct convolution or
# by using convolution theorem with [Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem). The discrete convolution theorem - for circular convolution of two sequences - allows us to efficiently calculate the output of convolution by first multiplying FFTs of the input sequences and then applying an inverse FFT. To utilize this theorem for non-circular convolutions as in our case, we need to pad the input sequences with zeros, and then unpad the output sequence.
# As the length gets longer this FFT method will be more efficient than the direct convolution,

# ### An SSM Neural Network.

# We now have all of the machinery needed to build a basic SSM neural network layer.
# As defined above, the discrete SSM defines a map from $\mathbb{R}^L
# \to \mathbb{R}^L$, i.e. a 1-D sequence map. We assume that we
# are going to be learning the parameters $B$ and $C$, as well as a
# step size $\Delta$ and a scalar $D$ parameter. The HiPPO matrix is
# used for the transition $A$. We learn the step size in log space.

# For the SSM layer most of the work is to build the filter.
# The actual call to the network is just the (huge) convolution we specified above.
#
# Note for Torch users: `setup` in Flax is called each time the parameters are updated.
# This is similar to the
# [Torch parameterizations](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/parametrizations.html).
#
# As noted above this same layer can be used either as an RNN or a CNN. The argument
# `decode` determines which path is used. In the case of RNN we cache the previous state
# at each call in a Flax variable collection called `cache`.

# This matrix is going to be really important, but it is a bit of
# magic. For our purposes we mainly need to know that: 1) we only need to
# calculate it once, and 2) it has a nice, simple structure (which we will exploit in
# part 2). Without going into the ODE math, the main takeaway
# is that this matrix aims to compress the past history into a state
# that has enough information to approximately reconstruct the history.

    A = P[:, np.newaxis] * P[np.newaxis, :]
    A = np.tril(A) - np.diag(np.arange(N))
    return -A


# Diving a bit deeper, the intuitive explanation of this matrix is
# that it produces a hidden state that memorizes its history. It does
# this by keeping track of the coefficients of a [Legendre
# polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials). These
# coefficients let it approximate all of the previous history. Let us
# look at an example,

# ## Part 2: Implementing S4

# Warning: this section has a lot of math. Roughly it boils down to finding a
# way to compute the filter from Part 1 for "HiPPO-like" matrices *really
# fast*. If you are interested, the details are really neat. If not,
# skip to Part 3 for some cool applications like MNIST completion.

# [Skip Button](#part-3-s4-in-practice)

# To set the stage, recall that S4 has two main differences from a basic SSM. The first addresses a *modeling challenge* - long-range dependencies - by using a special formula for the $\boldsymbol{A}$ matrix defined in the previous part. These special SSMs were considered in [predecessor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13985) works to S4.

# The second main feature of S4 solves the *computational challenge* of SSMs by introducing a special representation and algorithm to be able to work with this matrix!


# > The fundamental bottleneck in computing the discrete-time SSM
# > is that it involves repeated matrix multiplication by
# > $\boldsymbol{\overline{A}}$.  For example, computing
# > naively  involves $L$ successive multiplications
# > by $\boldsymbol{\overline{A}}$, requiring $O(N^2 L)$ operations and
# > $O(NL)$ space.

# Specifically, recall this function here:

# ```python
# def K_conv(Ab, Bb, Cb, L):
#    return np.array(
#        [(Cb @ matrix_power(Ab, l) @ Bb).reshape() for l in range(L)]
#    )
# ```

# The contribution of S4 is a stable method for speeding up this particular operation.
# To do this we are going to focus on the case where the SSM
# has special structure: specifically, Diagonal Plus Low-Rank (DPLR) in complex
# space.

# A **DPLR** SSM is $(\boldsymbol{\Lambda} - \boldsymbol{P}\boldsymbol{Q}^*, \boldsymbol{B}, \boldsymbol{C})$ for some diagonal $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ and matrices $\boldsymbol{P}, \boldsymbol{Q}, \boldsymbol{B}, \boldsymbol{C} \in \mathbb{C}^{N \times 1}$.
# We assume without loss of generality that the rank is $1$, i.e. these matrices are vectors.
#
# Under this DPLR assumption, S4 overcomes the speed bottleneck in three steps

#
# >  1. Instead of computing $\boldsymbol{\overline{K}}$ directly,
#     we compute its spectrum by evaluating its **[truncated generating function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_function)** .  This  now involves a matrix *inverse* instead of *power*.
# >  2. We show that the diagonal matrix case is equivalent to the computation of a **[Cauchy kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_matrix)** $\frac{1}{\omega_j - \zeta_k}$.
# >  3. We show the low-rank term can now be corrected by applying the **[Woodbury identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodbury_matrix_identity)** which reduces $(\boldsymbol{\Lambda} + \boldsymbol{P}\boldsymbol{Q}^*)^{-1}$ in terms of $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}^{-1}$, truly reducing to the diagonal case.


# ### Step 1. SSM Generating Functions

# The main step will be switching from computing the sequence to computing its generating function.
# From the paper's appendix:

# > To address the problem of computing powers of $\boldsymbol{\overline{A}}$, we introduce another technique.
# > Instead of computing the SSM convolution filter $\boldsymbol{\overline{K}}$ directly,
# > we introduce a generating function on its coefficients and compute evaluations of it.
# >
# >The *truncated SSM generating function* at node $z$ with truncation $L$ is
# $$
# \hat{\mathcal{K}}_L(z; \boldsymbol{\overline{A}}, \boldsymbol{\overline{B}}, \boldsymbol{\overline{C}}) \in \mathbb{C} := \sum_{i=0}^{L-1} \boldsymbol{\overline{C}} \boldsymbol{\overline{A}}^i \boldsymbol{\overline{B}} z^i
# $$


def K_gen_simple(Ab, Bb, Cb, L):
    K = K_conv(Ab, Bb, Cb, L)

    def gen(z):
        return np.sum(K * (z ** np.arange(L)))

    return gen


# > The generating function essentially converts the SSM convolution filter from the time domain to
# > frequency domain. This transformation is also called [z-transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-transform) (up to a minus sign) in control engineering literature. Importantly, it preserves the same information, and the desired SSM convolution filter
# > can be recovered. Once the z-transform of a discrete sequence known, we can obtain the filter's discrete fourier transform from evaluations of its
# > [z-transform at the roots of unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-transform#Inverse_Z-transform)
# $\Omega = \{ \exp(2\pi \frac{k}{L} : k \in [L] \}$. Then, we can apply inverse fourier transformation, stably in $O(L \log L)$ operations by applying an [FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform), to recover the filter.


def conv_from_gen(gen, L):
    # Evaluate at roots of unity
    # Generating function is (-)z-transform, so we evaluate at (-)root
    Omega_L = np.exp((-2j * np.pi) * (np.arange(L) / L))
    atRoots = jax.vmap(gen)(Omega_L)
    # Inverse FFT
    out = np.fft.ifft(atRoots, L).reshape(L)
    return out.real


# More importantly, in the generating function we can replace the matrix power with an inverse!
# $$
# \hat{\mathcal{K}}_L(z) = \sum_{i=0}^{L-1} \boldsymbol{\overline{C}} \boldsymbol{\overline{A}}^i \boldsymbol{\overline{B}} z^i = \boldsymbol{\overline{C}} (\boldsymbol{I} - \boldsymbol{\overline{A}}^L z^L) (\boldsymbol{I} - \boldsymbol{\overline{A}} z)^{-1} \boldsymbol{\overline{B}} = \boldsymbol{\widetilde{C}}  (\boldsymbol{I} - \boldsymbol{\overline{A}} z)^{-1} \boldsymbol{\overline{B}}
# $$

# And for all $z \in \Omega_L$, we have $z^L = 1$ so that term is removed. We then pull this constant
# term into a new $\boldsymbol{\widetilde{C}}$. Critically, this function **does not** call `K_conv`,


def K_gen_inverse(Ab, Bb, Cb, L):
    I = np.eye(Ab.shape[0])
    Ab_L = matrix_power(Ab, L)
    Ct = Cb @ (I - Ab_L)
    return lambda z: (Ct.conj() @ inv(I - Ab * z) @ Bb).reshape()


# But it does output the same values,


def test_gen_inverse(L=16, N=4):
    ssm = random_SSM(rng, N)
    ssm = discretize(*ssm, 1.0 / L)
    b = K_conv(*ssm, L=L)

    a = conv_from_gen(K_gen_inverse(*ssm, L=L), L)
    assert np.allclose(a, b)


#  In summary, Step 1 allows us to replace the matrix power with an
#  inverse by utilizing a truncated generating function.
#  However this inverse still needs to be calculated $L$
#  times (for each of the roots of unity).

# ### Step 2: Diagonal Case

# The next step to assume special *structure* on the matrix
# $\boldsymbol{A}$ to compute the inverse faster than the naive inversion.
# To begin, let us first convert the equation above to use the original SSM
# matrices. With some algebra you can expand the discretization and show:

# $$
# \begin{aligned}
#   \boldsymbol{\widetilde{C}}\left(\boldsymbol{I} - \boldsymbol{\overline{A}} \right)^{-1} \boldsymbol{\overline{B}}
#   =
#   \frac{2\Delta}{1+z} \boldsymbol{\widetilde{C}} \left[ {2 \frac{1-z}{1+z}} - \Delta \boldsymbol{A} \right]^{-1} \boldsymbol{B}
# \end{aligned}
# $$


# Now imagine $\boldsymbol{A}=\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ for a diagonal $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$. Substituting in the discretization
# formula the authors show that the generating function can be written in the following manner:

# $$ \begin{aligned}
# \boldsymbol{\hat{K}}_{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}(z) & = c(z) \sum_i \cdot \frac{\boldsymbol{\widetilde{C}}_i \boldsymbol{B}_i} {(g(z) - \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_i)} = c(z) \cdot k_{z, \boldsymbol{\Lambda}}(\boldsymbol{\widetilde{C}}, \boldsymbol{B}) \\
#  \end{aligned}$$
# where $c$ is a constant, and $g$ is a function of $z$.


# We have effectively replaced an inverse with a weighted dot product.
# Let's make a small helper function to compute this weight dot product for use.


def cauchy_dot(v, omega, lambd):
    return (v / (omega - lambd)).sum()


# While not important for our implementation, it is worth noting that
# this is a [Cauchy
# kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_matrix) and is the
# subject of many other [fast
# implementations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_multipole_method).


# ### Step 3: Diagonal Plus Low-Rank

# The final step is to relax the diagonal assumption. In addition to
# the diagonal term we allow a low-rank component with
# $\boldsymbol{P}, \boldsymbol{Q} \in \mathbb{C}^{N\times 1}$ such that:

# $$
# \boldsymbol{A} = \boldsymbol{\Lambda} - \boldsymbol{P}  \boldsymbol{Q}^*
# $$

# The [Woodbury identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodbury_matrix_identity)
# tells us that the inverse of a diagonal plus rank-1 term is equal to the
# inverse of the diagonal plus a rank-1 term. We write it out here
# adding the low-rank term.

# $$ \begin{aligned}
# (\boldsymbol{\Lambda} + \boldsymbol{P}  \boldsymbol{Q}^*)^{-1} &= \boldsymbol{\Lambda}^{-1} - \boldsymbol{\Lambda}^{-1} \boldsymbol{P} (1 + \boldsymbol{Q}^* \boldsymbol{\Lambda}^{-1} \boldsymbol{P})^{-1} \boldsymbol{Q}^* \boldsymbol{\Lambda}^{-1}
#  \end{aligned}
# $$

#  There is a bunch of algebra in the appendix. It mostly consists of substituting this component in for A,
#  applying the Woodbury identity and distributing terms. We end up with 4 terms that
#  all look like Step 2 above:

# $$ \begin{aligned}
# \boldsymbol{\hat{K}}_{DPLR}(z) & = c(z) [k_{z, \Lambda}(\boldsymbol{\widetilde{C}}, \boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{B}}) - k_{z, \Lambda}(\boldsymbol{\widetilde{C}}, \boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{P}}) (1 + k_{z, \Lambda}(\boldsymbol{q^*}, \boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{P}}) )^{-1} k_{z, \Lambda}(\boldsymbol{q^*}, \boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{B}}) ]
#  \end{aligned}$$


# The code consists of collecting up the terms and applying 4 weighted dot products,


def K_gen_DPLR(Lambda, P, Q, B, C, step, unmat=False):
    aterm = (C.conj(), Q.conj())
    bterm = (B, P)

    def gen(o):

        c = 2.0 / (1.0 + o)

        def k(a):
            # Checkpoint this calculation for memory efficiency.
            if unmat:
                return jax.remat(cauchy_dot)(a, g, Lambda)
            else:

    return gen


# This is our final version of the $K$ function. Because `conv_from_gen` is always called together with a generating function (e.g. `K_gen_DPLR`), we'll fuse them into define a dedicated function to compute the DPLR SSM kernel from all of its parameters. (With fewer layers of indirection, this could also make it easier for XLA compiler to optimize.)

# ### Turning HiPPO to DPLR

# This approach applies to DPLR matrices, but remember we would like it to also apply to the HiPPO matrix.
#  While not DPLR in its current form, the HiPPO matrix *does have special structure*. It is
#  Normal Plus Low-Rank (NPLR). Because [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_matrix) matrices are exactly the class of matrices that are unitarily diagonalizable, NPLR matrices are essentially equivalent to DPLR matrices from the perspective of SSM models.
# this is just as good as DPLR for the purposes of learning an SSM network.

# > The S4 techniques can apply to any matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ that can be decomposed as *Normal Plus Low-Rank (NPLR)*.
# $$
# >   \boldsymbol{A} = \boldsymbol{V} \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \boldsymbol{V}^* - \boldsymbol{P} \boldsymbol{Q}^\top = \boldsymbol{V} \left( \boldsymbol{\Lambda} - \boldsymbol{V}^* \boldsymbol{P} (\boldsymbol{V}^*\boldsymbol{Q})^* \right) \boldsymbol{V}^*
# $$
# > for [unitary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_matrix) $\boldsymbol{V} \in \mathbb{C}^{N \times N}$, diagonal $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$, and low-rank factorization $\boldsymbol{P}, \boldsymbol{Q} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times r}$.  An NPLR SSM is therefore unitarily equivalent to some DPLR matrix.


#  For S4, we need to work with a HiPPO matrix for $\boldsymbol{A}$. This requires first writing it as a normal plus low-rank term, and then diagonalizing to extract
#  $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ from this decomposition. The appendix of the paper shows how
#  by writing the normal part as a [skew-symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew-symmetric_matrix) (plus a constant times the identity matrix), which are a special class of normal matrices.

# An additional simplification is that there is actually a representation that ties the low-rank components terms $\boldsymbol{P} = \boldsymbol{Q}$, which was shown in [follow-up work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09729) to be important for stability.


def make_NPLR_HiPPO(N):

    nhippo = make_HiPPO(N)

    # Add in a rank 1 term. Makes it Normal.
    P = np.sqrt(np.arange(N) + 0.5)

    # HiPPO also specifies the B matrix
    B = np.sqrt(2 * np.arange(N) + 1.0)
    return nhippo, P, B


# After extracting the normal part, we can diagonalize to get out the DPLR terms.
# Because the normal part is actually skew-symmetric, we can extract the real and complex parts of $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ separately.
# This serves two purposes. First, this gives us finer-grained control over the real and imaginary parts, which can be used to improve stability. Second, this lets us use more powerful diagonalization algorithms for [Hermitian matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_matrix) - in fact, the current version of JAX does not support GPU diagonalization for non-Hermitian matrices!

# ## Part 3: S4 in Practice

# That was a lot of work, but now the actual model is concise. In fact
# we are only using four functions:


# 1. `K_gen_DPLR` → Truncated generating function when $\boldsymbol{A}$ is DPLR (S4-part)
# 2. `conv_from_gen` → Convert generating function to filter
# 3. `causal_convolution` → Run convolution
# 4. `discretize_DPLR` → Convert SSM to discrete form for RNN.


# ### S4 CNN / RNN Layer

#  A full S4 Layer is very similar to the simple SSM layer above. The
#  only difference is in the the computation of $\boldsymbol{K}$.
#  Additionally instead of learning $\boldsymbol{C}$, we learn
#  $\boldsymbol{\widetilde{C}}$ so we avoid computing powers of
#  $\boldsymbol{A}$. Note as well that in the original paper $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}, \boldsymbol{P}, \boldsymbol{Q}$ are
#  also learned. However, in this post, we leave them fixed for simplicity.

# ### Experiments: MNIST

# Now that we have the model, we can try it out on some MNIST experiments.
# For these experiments we linearize MNIST and just treat each image as a sequence of
# pixels.

# The first experiments we ran were on MNIST classification. While
# not in theory a hard problem, treating MNIST as a linear sequence
# classification task is a bit strange. However in practice, the model
# with $H=256$ and four layers seems to get up near 99% right away.

# A more visually interesting task is generating MNIST digits, by predicting entire
# sequences of pixels! Here, we simply feed in a sequence of pixels into the model and have it
# predict the next one like language modeling. With a little
# tweaking, we are able to get the model to an NLL of 0.36 on this
# task with size 512 and 6 layers (~4m parameters).
#
# The metric usually used for this task is *[bits per
# dimension](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-generation-on-mnist)* which is
# NLL in base 2 for MNIST. A loss of 0.36 is ~0.52 BPD which is SOTA according to PapersWithCode.

# Finally we played with modeling sound waves directly. For these, we

# [Free Spoken Digits Datasets](https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset)
# an MNIST like dataset of various speakers reading off digits. We
# first trained a classification model and found that the approach was
# able to reach $97\%$ accuracy just from the raw soundwave. Next we
# trained a generation model to produce the sound wave directly. With
# $H=512$ the model seems to pick up the data relatively well. This
# dataset only has around 3000 examples, but the model can produce
# reasonably good (cherry-picked) continuations. Note these sequences are 6400 steps
# long at an 8kHz sampling rate, discretized to 256 classes with
# [Mu Law Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9C-law_algorithm).

# ## Conclusion


# Putting together this post inspired lots of thoughts about future
# work in this area. One obvious conclusion is that long-range
# models have all sorts of future applications from acoustic modeling to
# genomic sequences to trajectories (not to mention our shared area of
# NLP). Another is some surprise that linear models can be so effective
# here, while also opening up a range of efficient techniques.
# Finally from a practical level, the transformations in JAX
# make it really nice to implement complex models like this
# in a very concise way (~200 LoC), with similar efficiency and performance!
